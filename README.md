# What does this repository contain?
This is the repository with my personal sublime configuration files.
I used to program using Visual Studio including the Visual Assist X extension so the config
is aiming at providing a similar experience.

**Note: I'm using Sublime Text 3. I don't know if this configuration is also applicable for Sublime Text 2.**

# How can I add these config files to my sublime setup?

## Windows
Move the files in the 'Packages' folder to the *InstalledPackages* folder to you local Sublime installation, the rest of the files can be copied into the *Data/Packages/User* folder of your local Sublime installation, or alternatively, to the *Sublime Text 3* folder inside the *C:/Users/{user}/AppData/Roaming/* directory.

## Linux
Move all the files from the folders of this repository to the */home/{user}/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/User/* folder.
