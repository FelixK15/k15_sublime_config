#What does this repository contain?
This is the repository with my personal sublime configuration files.
I used to program using Visual Studio including the Visual Assist X extension so the config
is aiming at providing a similar experience.

**Note: I'm using Sublime Text 3. I don't know if this configuration is also applicable for Sublime Text 2.**

#How can I add these config files to my sublime setup?

##Windows
You can basically just move all the files from the folders of this repository to 
the *Data/Packages/User* folder of your local Sublime installation.

##Linux
(Soon)
